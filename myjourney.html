<section class="year">
    <h2>Year 1</h2>
    <p>Starting my journey at Thammasat University as a CSTU student,
         I have learned many new things like programming langauge 
         such as HTML, CSS, C++ and more. I have a many new friends when im entered
         university.
    </p>

<section class="year">
    <h2>Year 2</h2>
    <p>In the second year, I expect to dive deeper into advanced concepts like data structures, object-oriented programming, and databases.
         By then, I aim to be comfortable writing more efficient code and tackling complex problems. 
         I will work on larger personal projects, such as developing simple web applications or engaging in
         collaborative projects with my peers.
        </p>
</section>

<section class="year">
    <h2>Year 3</h2>
    <p>The third year will mark a turning point as I begin to specialize in specific fields that align with my interests and career goals.
         Whether it’s artificial intelligence, data science, or software development, 
         I plan to focus on building in-depth knowledge and skills. This year, I also aim to secure an 
         internship or work on industry-related projects to gain practical experience in a real-world environment.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="year">
    <h2>Year 4</h2>
    <p>In my final year, I plan to bring everything together by working on a significant capstone project that will
         showcase my learning and abilities. This project will likely be focused on 
         solving a real-world problem using the skills I've accumulated throughout my 
         studies, whether that involves developing an AI-driven solution, building a scalable
          web application, or addressing a cybersecurity challenge.
